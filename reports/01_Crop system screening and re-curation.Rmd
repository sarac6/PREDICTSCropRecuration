This screening and re-curation was performed in May-June 2022 by Sara Contu.


### Why the need for this screening?

By using the PREDICTS curated crop data it came to light that there were some issues that needed attention and re-curation:


### **1. Dubious mixed crop systems**

Studies were multiple crops listed in the crop field are not really representing mixed crop system.


### **2. Inconsistency between the PREDICTS LHU1 and the crop classification**

Sites that had a Predominant habitat not associated to crops (i.e., Pasture), had crop information in the crop field. 


### **3. Predicts site blocks that lack Magpie classes**

The are a number of blocks of site (~500) within xx number of studies for which the Predominant habitat is either: Cropland or Plantation Forest but the crop name and Magpie class are missing. 
This screening addressed this issue by adding any crop name and Magpie class to the file Andy was working on, as well as re-curating the original Excel files and re-upload them onto the database. 



### Recuration of 1. Dubious mixed crop systems


In using the curated crop data, it has become clear that there are at least some PREDICTS studies where multiple crops are listed for cropland sites, not because the site is in a field where multiple crops are grown, but because the agricultural landscape as a whole contains more than a single crop. This weakens attempts to estimate crop-specific coefficients, and particularly to test whether within-field crop diversity mitigates effects on biodiversity.

The source publications for these studies will then be checked to see whether there is positive evidence that the sites each contain multiple crops and, if so, whether the crops can be identified with an acceptable level of confidence (which I would define as better than 50% chance, i.e., can we say what was probably being grown?). Thus, one possible outcome from the re-curation will be the removal of too-precise information about crop identity.

There are 41 studies that have dubious multiple crops and that need looking at.

**Re-curation steps:**

1. look at the article to assess whether the study is looking at a mixed crop system or whether there are just multiple crops being grown at landscape level.

2. check whether data from author provide any information at site level

What should go in the Crop field during recuration?

1. If the crop or crops can be identified, then the crop name(s) should be entered.

2. If the crop or crops cannot be identified specifically, but can be fitted into one of the fine-grained MAgPIE classes being used in the NatuRisk project, name the MAgPIE class, as follows (taking care to copy the category name exactly):

* M_OtherCereals: If it is one or more cereal crops other than rice or maize
* M_OtherOilSeed: If it is one or more oil seed crops other than coconut, oil palm, sunflower, groundnuts (peanuts), soy or cottonseed. Other nuts are only in this category if the paper explicitly says they are being grown for oil
* M_Pulses: If it is one or more unspecified legumes
* M_Veg: If it is one or more unspecified vegetables or soft fruit grown as annuals (e.g., grown like tomatoes), including annual root crops grown outside of the tropics
* M_Nuts: If it is one or more unspecified nuts, unless the paper explicitly says they are being grown for oil (in which case they go in M_OtherOilSeed)
*M_Fruit: One or more unspecified fruit grown as perennials; any unnamed fruittree, shrub or vine would fall into this class.
* M_Roots: Unspecified root crops grown in the tropics.

3. If the crop or crops cannot be identified to a fine-grained MAgPIE class, it may still be possible to place it into one of the coarse-grained MAgPIE classes being used in the NatuRisk project, as follows (taking care to copy the category name exactly):
* M_FORAGE: Unspecified fodder crops; hay
* M_CEREALS: Any and all cereal crops
* M_OILCROPS: Any and all oil-seed crops
* M_SUGAR: Sugar cane or sugar beet (though it should be possible to distinguish between these)
* M_BIOENERGY: Second-generation biomass/biofuel crops, which might be grasses such as Miscanthus or trees like eucalypts.
* M_OTHERANNUAL: Vegetables
* M_OTHERPERENNIAL: Fruit and nuts not covered in M_OILCROPS
Lastly, if the crop or crops cannot be identified but it is clear whether the site had a single crop or multiple crops, then after any MAgPIE classes, add “single” or “multiple”
Labelling the crops in this way will allow the models to pick out exactly the right data and not draw any unsupported inferences.

#### Outcome 1: It is **not a mixed crop system**

*Actions*:

-   Remove the crop/s species names from the "Crop" field in the PREDICTS Excel form.
-   Make sure it is not down as Mixed crop in the FF1 and FF2 fields
-   Add comment on the actions taken in the Pdf and Excel files
-   Re-upload the curated files into the database

#### Outcome 2: It is a **mixed crop system**

*Actions*:

-   Update the FF1 field to "Mixed Farming"\
-   Update FF2 fields to reflect which mixed system is:
    1)  Mixed cropping
    2)  Mixed livestock
    3)  Mixed crops-livestock
-   Add comment on the actions taken in the Pdf and Excel files
-   Re-upload the curated files into the database

### Summary

| Screened studies | Mixed crop system | Other |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:------|
| 41               | 5                 | 1     |

The one study in the "other" group is HW1_2011\_\_Cerezo. This is a mixed crop system as the sampling points are along roads, and they are surrounded by different crops fields, creating a system of multiple crops for the birds sampled.

For details on each study see file "StudiesWithDubiousMultipleCrops_SC"

```{r, echo=TRUE}
  # this files contains the information gathered by the re-curation investigation.

  StudiesWithDubiousMultipleCrops_SC <- read.csv("../data/StudiesWithDubiousMultipleCrops_SC.csv") 

```


#### Lessons learnt:

-   From this experience it clearly comes out that it is easy to mis-interpret the site level to the landscape level information. It is common to have the FF1 and FF2 agricultural classification with "mixed farming" when the mix farming is not at the site but at landscape level (i.e. TN1_2009\_\_Peters, is down as Mixed Farming as the text mentions "agricultural land (supporting mainly subsistence agriculture growing maize, sugar cane and tea)", but this is true at landscape level and it does not mean that those sites support mixed systems.

-   if we need more accurate level of crop information, I could put together a document with examples of common crops and how to classify them. It took me a bit to decide which combination of FF1,2,3 fields was the correct one for Cocoa and Coffee - Arable, Permanent, Fruit.

#### Questions

-   What is the difference between FF1 Mixed crop and an FF1 Arable field crop with "various field crop combined? These two combinations appear to be the same thing really, as per FAO definitions; are they the same thing for PREDICTS? if not we need to specify how or when coding you should account for the two things to be possibly just the same.

| FF1           | FF2            | FF3                                                                  |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Mixed farming | Mixed cropping | Specifics of the system (i.e.,3.1.3 Field crops and permanent crops) |
| Arable        | Field crop     | Various field crop combined                                          |

I always thought the difference would have been between space and time, but following on the FAO definition they are the same thing.

### Recuration of 2. Inconsistency between the PREDICTS LHU1 and the crop classification

The code utilized by Andy to analyses PREDICTS land use classification and the curated crop data was showing inconsistency between LHU1 and the crop classification (i.e., there are crops where there shouldn't be). The information in the crop fields in cases like this, have been initially ignored and the work included just the predicts habitat classification. But by looking at a study, affecting a large number of sites (31), where LUH1 says Pasture and the crop-curation code says Forage, and actually the PREDICTS classification for these sites was wrong in both studies - the fields are used to grow fodder, rather than being grazed.

I have looked at all the studies that were showing such inconsistency and these are the steps I have taken:

 - I have looked at all the inconsistencies and re-curated the Excel files.
 - Re-uploaded the curated files into the database so that data will be right for future users.

### Recuration of 3. Predicts site blocks that lack Magpie classes

There are over 510 blocks of sites in the PREDICTS database that don't have enough information to put them into a Magpie top-level class.

File: "Blocks_to_check_for_crops.csv" [PurvisLab-PREDICTSforbusiness/Shared/Document/PREDICTS for business/Blocks_to_check_for_crops.csv] 


Each block that need to be checked will have a row per Predominant Habitat (so if a block has Cropland and Plantation forest, it will have two rows). 

Actions: 
 
 - priority to be given to the blocks that have a baseline site
 - check papers and data from author to fetch available information
 - fill in any crop names, the Magpie1 class the crop belongs to and the Magpie2 classes
 - used the MagpieHierchy.csv as reference to assign Magpie classes.
